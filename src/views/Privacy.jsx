          </li>

          transferred, as well as the existence or absence of an adequacy
          decision by the Commission.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Data of Minors</h2>
        <p>
          Respecting the provisions of Articles 8 of the GDPR and 7 of the
          Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Protection of Personal Data and
          guarantee of digital rights, only individuals over 14 years of age can
          provide their consent for the lawful processing of their personal data
          by andreagimenez. If the individual is under 14 years of age, the
          consent of their parents or legal guardians will be required for the
          processing, and it will only be considered lawful to the extent that
          they have authorized it.
        </p>

        <h2>Secrecy and Security of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          andreagimenez commits to adopting the necessary technical and
          organizational measures, according to the appropriate security level
          corresponding to the risk of the collected data, to ensure the
          security of personal data and prevent its destruction, loss, or
          accidental or unlawful alteration, or unauthorized communication or
          access to such data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Website has an SSL certificate (Secure Socket Layer), which
          ensures that personal data is transmitted securely and confidentially,
          as data transmission between the server and the User, and in feedback,
          is fully encrypted.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, since andreagimenez cannot guarantee the impregnability of
          the internet or the total absence of hackers or others who may
          fraudulently access personal data, the Data Controller undertakes to
          promptly inform the User of any security breach involving a high risk
          to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Pursuant to Article 4 of
          the GDPR, a security breach involving personal data refers to any
          breach of security that leads to the accidental or unlawful
          destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access
          to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal data will be treated as confidential by the Data Controller,
          who commits to ensuring, by means of legal or contractual obligation,
          that such confidentiality is respected by its employees, associates,
          and anyone who may have access to the information.
        </p>

          <li className="p li">
            Right to data portability: Where the processing is carried out by
