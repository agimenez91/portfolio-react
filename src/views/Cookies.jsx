        <h2>Responsible Entity</h2>
        <p>
          The entity responsible for the collection, processing, and use of your

          andreagimenez, owned by Andrea Giménez Usó - Av. Perez Galdós 86.
        </p>

        <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are sets of data that a server deposits in a user's browser to
          collect standard internet registration information and visitor
          behavior information on a website. In other words, they are small text
          files that are stored on the computer's hard drive and used to
          identify the user when they revisit the website. Their purpose is to
          record the user's visit and store certain information. Cookies are
          common and widely used on the web as they allow pages to function more
          efficiently and provide greater personalization and analysis of user
          behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          The cookies used on our website are session and third-party cookies,
          allowing us to store and access information related to language, the
          type of browser used, and other general preferences set by the user.
          They also help us track and analyze user activity to introduce
          improvements and provide services more efficiently and personalized.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on their duration, cookies can be divided into session
          cookies or permanent cookies. Session cookies expire when the user
          closes the browser, while permanent cookies expire when their purpose
          is fulfilled (e.g., to keep the user identified on Andrea Giménez
          Usó's services) or when manually deleted.

        <h2>Types of Cookies Based on Purpose:</h2>

        <h3>Performance Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          This type of cookie remembers your preferences for tools found in the
          services, so you don't have to reconfigure the service every time you
          visit. For example, this category includes volume settings for video
          or audio players, video streaming speeds compatible with your browser,
          and items saved in the e-commerce "shopping cart" in online stores.
        </p>

        <h3>Geolocation Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to determine the country you are in when
          requesting a service. This cookie is entirely anonymous and only used
          to help target content to your location.
        </p>

        <h3>Registration Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Registration cookies are generated when a user registers or
          subsequently logs in. They are used to identify the user in the
          services for the following purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="p li">
            Keeping the user identified so that if they close a service, the
            browser, or the computer and later return to that service, they will
            still be identified, making navigation easier without having to log
            in again. This functionality can be deleted if the user clicks the
            "logout" function, which deletes this cookie. The next time the user
            enters the service, they will need to log in again to be identified.
          </li>
          <li className="p li">
            Verifying if the user is authorized to access certain services, such
            as participating in a contest.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, some services may use connectors with social networks
          such as Facebook or Twitter. When the user registers for a service
          using social network credentials, they authorize the social network to
          save a persistent cookie that remembers their identity and grants
          access to the services until it expires. The user can delete this
          cookie and revoke access to the services through social networks by
          updating their preferences on the specific social network.
        </p>

        <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Every time a user visits a service, an analytical cookie is generated
          on the user's computer by an external provider's tool. This cookie is
          only generated during the visit and will serve on future visits to
          Andrea Giménez Usó's services to anonymously identify the visitor. The
          main objectives are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="p li">
            Allowing the anonymous identification of browsing users through the
            cookie (identifying browsers and devices, not individuals) and thus
            roughly counting the number of visitors and their trend over time.
          </li>
          <li className="p li">
            Anonymous identification of the most visited and, therefore, most
            attractive content for users.
          </li>
          <li className="p li">
            Determining whether the user accessing the services is new or
            returning.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Important: Unless the user decides to register for a service of Andrea
          Giménez Usó, the cookie will never be associated with any personally
          identifiable data. These cookies will only be used for statistical
          purposes to optimize users' experience on the site.
        </p>

        <h3>Advertising Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          This type of cookies allows expanding the information of the ads shown
          to each anonymous user in the services of Andrea Giménez Usó. It
          includes storing the duration or frequency of ad display, interaction
          with ads, or user navigation patterns and behaviors to create a
          profile of advertising interest. This way, it enables offering
          advertising related to the user's interests.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-Party Advertising Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the advertising managed by Andrea Giménez Usó's
          websites in their services, Andrea Giménez Usó's websites offer
          advertisers the option to serve ads through third parties
          ("Ad-Servers"). Thus, these third parties may store cookies sent from
          Andrea Giménez Usó's services from users' browsers and access the data
          stored in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Companies generating these cookies have their own privacy policies.
          Currently, Andrea Giménez Usó's websites use the Doubleclick platform
